## About

Thanks for checking out our experimental block-based theme using block templates and theme starter content to bootstrap a WordPress site. 

[Demo](https://sideways.sidetrack.studio/)

The file structure follows the WordPress theme experiment [sideways](https://github.com/WordPress/theme-experiments/tree/master/sideways), a block-based theme experiment by Jeff Ong.

## Getting Started

1. Create a fresh WordPress site
2. Clone this repository or upload a zip into the siteâ€™s `themes` directory
3. Install and activate the [Gutenberg](https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/)
4. Enable the Full Site Editing and Full Site Editing Demo Templates experiments in `Gutenberg > Experiments` panel:
5. Visit the Customizer and hit "Publish"

## How this theme was developed

The following resources helped to become familiar with the concepts applied in this theme:

- [Block-based themes (Experimental)](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/developers/themes/block-based-themes/)
- [Full Site Editing feature development in Gutenberg](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/labels/%5BFeature%5D%20Full%20Site%20Editing)
- [Theme starter content](https://roots.io/using-and-customizing-wordpress-starter-content/)

The steps to developing a theme using block templates with starter content are as follows: 

1. Developed block templates using the editor. 
2. Copy and paste those templates into static files in the `block-templates` 
3. Define the starter content for the site in `functions.php`
